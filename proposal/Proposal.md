# Project Description

#### Proposal:
An android app that will allow the user to receive updates on live sporting events by means of Audio readout/text updates. There are numerous online personalities that cover sporting events on social media, we will use data from these updates through scraping/APIs to generate frequent updates. The user will be able to tailor their experience by using built in functions to refine the sports they would like to follow and be updated on. Yet another level of customisation will be that the user can choose to only follow specific events within a certain sport e.g. Real Madrid vs. Barcelona within soccer. Furthermore, where possible the user will also be able to choose to receive specific information within their chosen sport. For example, an update might look like; A player has received a red card, a goal scored or a new driver is in 1st place. The user will also be able to choose to star an event, this will record all the updates of that event temporarily so that they have a chance to review the event. The application is designed with busy lifestyle in mind, for the user to receive updates with little input, allowing them to get on with their day to day tasks while also staying informed with potentially long sporting events that would otherwise be difficult to watch in their entirety e.g. Tour De France, 24h Le Mans. The app will place emphasis on being accessible to a wide range of users through its text to audio feature and text notifications, this will insure that whether the user is interacting with the android phone or not they will be kept up to date.
